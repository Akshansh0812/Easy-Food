# Easy Food 

I developed a user-friendly food recipe app from scratch, curating a vast collection of culinary 
delights. Through my expertise in UI design and feature development, I crafted an intuitive app that allowed 
users to explore, save, and recreate delicious recipes from diverse cuisines. The app offered a seamless 
navigation experience, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable cooking journey for food enthusiasts.

# Libraries and technologies used
**Navigation component :** One activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activites.

**Retrofit :** : Making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert meal json file to Kotlin/Java object.

**Room :** Save meals in local database.

**MVVM & LiveData :** Seperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.

**Coroutines :** Do some code in the background.

**View Binding :** Instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.

**Glide :** Catch images and load them in imageView.
